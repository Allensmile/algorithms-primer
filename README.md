# algorithms-primer
A consolidated collection of resources for you to learn and understand algorithms and data structures easily. 

# Objectives
It is difficult to find consolidated resources on algorithms. 
This repo hopes to gather resources to help one understand algorithms better to prepare 
for technical tests or simply to strengthen your foundation of computer science to help you become a better coder.

# Contributions
Contributions are more than welcome. I cant do everything myself, so I will need all the help I can get. To 
- add a new section or to 
- add on to existing sections, 
- or translate
simply submit a pull request. 

If you are arent sure of how to create a pull request, view the [pull request documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

#Algorithms Topics
Summaries of the algorithms topics:

### Brute force method
Brute force is simplest way to explore the space of solutions - simply means to go through all solutions, however unlikely they may be, something which is not particularly elegant.

## Dynamic Programming (DP)
What is DP?
DP or dynamic optimization basically means to take our problem and somehow break it down into
a reasonable number of subproblems so that we can use optimal solutions to the smaller subproblems to give us optimal solutions to the larger ones.

Allows solve many different types of problems in time O(n)^2 or O(n)^3
Usually focused on Principle of Optimality, "An optimal solution to any instance of an optimization problem is composed of optimal solutions to its subinstances"

### Memoization vs Tabulation
Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. 

Which is better?


### Greedy Algorithms 

### Knapsack problem with Repetitions
Knapsack problem or the rucksack problem is part of dynamic programming and it is where given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
